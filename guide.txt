LETTER OF INTRODUCTION
Dear Olentangy High School Student:

Planning and selecting courses in high school is an essential step toward achieving your
future goals. This Course Planning Guide is designed to assist you and your family in
navigating state-required classes for diploma completion and exploring the wide range of
elective options available. Thoughtful course selection will help you discover your
interests and prepare you for one or more of the 4 “E”s: enrollment in college,
employment in the workforce, enlistment in the military, or entrepreneurship as a career
path.

This guide provides a comprehensive overview of the robust curriculum offered at
Olentangy high schools. For required courses, which follow a prescribed sequence, your
teachers will recommend the next step in their department’s progression. These courses
will be pre-entered for you, allowing you to concentrate on choosing elective courses
that align with your passions and aspirations.
Once course recommendations have been made by you and your teachers, your family
will have an opportunity to review and verify the selections. Additionally, you will meet
with a school counselor during the year to finalize and schedule your course requests.
Our goal is to support you in making informed decisions about your class selections and
to help ensure your high school experience sets you on a path to success, whatever your
future holds. Please don’t hesitate to reach out if you have questions or need assistance.

Sincerely,
High School Administrators and School Counselors

ACADEMIC OVERVIEW AND GRADUATION
SUMMARY OF GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS
Ohio’s graduation requirements consist of three components: (1) Course Completion, (2) Competency and
(3) Readiness. More specific information for graduation can be found here: Ohio’s Graduation
Requirements. Ohio Revised Code section 3313.618
COURSE COMPLETION. To graduate and receive a diploma, a student must meet the graduation
requirements set forth by the Ohio Department of Education, as well as any local requirements. Olentangy
Local School’s requirements for graduation include earning twenty-two (22) units of credit in grades nine
through twelve as outlined in Figure 1.
For students enrolled in special education, the criteria for graduation and the extent of participation in the
State mandated assessment tests will be determined by each student’s IEP team. No student shall be
required to remain in school for any specific number of semesters or other terms if the student completes
the required curriculum early. Additional units of credit may extend and broaden this education, or the
additional units of credit may be devoted to specialized vocational or academic work.

CREDIT

22 Total Credits Required for Graduation
Figure 1. Requirements for graduation at Olentangy Local Schools.
1
Mathematics units must include at least one (1) unit of Algebra II or equivalent.
2Students may be exempt from the physical education requirement if they utilize the District physical
education waiver policy. Another one-half (.5) credit course must be taken in its place.
3Science must include one (1) unit of physical sciences, one (1) unit of life sciences, and one (1) unit of
advanced study in one or more of the following sciences: chemistry, physics, or other physical sciences;
advanced biology or other life science; astronomy, physical geology, or other earth or space science.
4Students must earn credit in U.S. History, U.S. Government, Economics, and World History.
5Students must earn one (1) unit of Fine Arts (visual or performing arts) or otherwise satisfy the arts
requirement of the Ohio Core by successfully completing two (2) semesters or the equivalent of Fine Arts in
grades 7-12.
6Elective units must include any combination of world language, fine arts, business, career-technical
education, family and consumer sciences, technology, or English language arts, mathematics, science or
social studies courses not otherwise required.
2025-26 OLENTANGY COURSE PLANNING GUIDE
3
COMPETENCY. In addition to earning credits, students will demonstrate competency in the foundational
areas of English language arts and mathematics. The Ohio Department of Education and Workforce
determined that “competency” would be set at a score of 684. Students must earn a score of 684 or higher
on both the Algebra I and English 10 Ohio State tests to meet this requirement. Ohio Revised Code section
3301.0712(B)(10). Alternative Demonstrations of Competency are explained in this link: Demonstrating
Competency.
READINESS. In addition to earning credits and demonstrating competency, students will show readiness
for their post-high school paths by earning two diploma seals, one of which must be a state seal, that allow
them to demonstrate important foundational and well-rounded academic and technical knowledge,
professional skills, and leadership and reasoning skills. The district Graduation Requirements for 2026 and
beyond shares details about diploma seals.

TESTING REQUIREMENTS FOR GRADUATION
For the class of 2023 and beyond, students will take six end-of-the course exams: English II, Algebra I,
Geometry, Biology, American History and American Government.

EARLY GRADUATION REQUIREMENTS
Students seeking to accelerate their four-year high school academic program should contact the principal
for approval. An Early Graduation Request Form obtained from Student Services should be completed prior
to the parent/counselor/administrative conference that will be required to review the request.

HONORS AT GRADUATION
Academic Recognition at Commencement
A growth mindset in all academic and co-curricular pursuits is encouraged at Olentangy Schools’ high
schools. Ranking students on GPAs for college admission, however, diminishes the growth mindset. As
such, the high schools will honor students at graduation and commencement, based upon the following
standards of achievement:

Students will be honored at commencement based on the following cumulative weighted GPA scale.
Summa Cum Laude: 4.000 GPA and above
Magna Cum Laude: 3.800 to 3.999
Cum Laude: 3.670 to 3.799

The high schools will recognize as valedictorian(s) anyone who achieves the highest cumulative GPA in the
class at the end of the seventh and/or eighth semester. To be eligible, a student must have attended an
Olentangy high school for his/her/their entire fifth through eighth semesters.
The following ranking is used for certain senior honors.
1. Class rank shall be computed by the final grade in specific subjects.
2. The rank of the student will be determined by grade point average. All students receiving the same
GPA shall receive the same class rank.
3. In recognition of the heavier burden of Advanced Placement and College Credit Plus classes, grade
point averages shall be weighted by awarding up to 1.0 extra unit.
4. A student’s grade point average and rank in class shall be entered only on their record and shall be
subject to the board’s policy on release of student records. A student’s class rank is used for internal
purposes and is not released to colleges and/or other institutions or agencies without prior written
consent from the individual or his/her/their parents/legal guardians if the student younger than
eighteen (18) years of age.
2025-26 OLENTANGY COURSE PLANNING GUIDE

Regular Diploma
A diploma will be issued to students who meet all requirements of the Ohio Department of Education and
Olentangy Board of Education for graduation.

Honors Diploma
High school students can gain state recognition for exceeding Ohio’s graduation requirements through an
honors diploma. Students challenge themselves by taking and succeeding at high-level coursework and in
real-world experiences. Ohio students have the opportunity to choose to pursue one of six honors
diplomas.
Academic Honors Diploma
International Baccalaureate Honors Diploma
Career Tech Honors Diploma
STEM Honors Diploma
Arts Honors Diploma
Social Science and Civic Engagement Honors Diploma

Additional details about the options for the honors diplomas are linked.
COURSE PLANNING INFORMATION
COURSE RECOMMENDATION
Olentangy teachers make course recommendations for all students using achievement test information
and personal knowledge of the student and their learning. Parents and students who disagree with a
teacher’s recommendation should follow the Course Parental Override Procedure outlined in the next
section.

COURSE PARENTAL OVERRIDE PROCEDURE
Olentangy teachers make specific recommendations about which courses are most appropriate for their
students using standardized achievement test data, current and previous course grade history, and specific
knowledge of their students. If a student and their parents wish to take a course the student’s teacher has
not recommended, a course parental override conference may be held, and an override form must be
completed by the student and parent(s). If the student has trouble in the course and wants to drop it, they
may receive a "WF" (withdraw F) in the course.

COLLEGE ADMISSIONS
Those who intend to go to college should become aware of the entrance requirements of the college or
university they wish to attend and organize and schedule their high school curriculum to meet these
requirements. Students who are undecided about their choice of a college but who wish to be prepared for
minimum admission standards should take the suggested college prep curriculum as defined by the Ohio
Board of Regents (the governing board for all Ohio colleges and universities). The recommended college
preparation requirements are listed in the following table. The number indicated in the parentheses
represents the recommended number of units for strong preparation for university admission. These
recommendations exclude the required electives, such as Health and Financial Literacy.

2025-26 OLENTANGY COURSE PLANNING GUIDE
5
College Prep English 4 Units
College Prep Mathematics 4 Units
College Prep Science 3 (4) Units
College Prep Social Studies 2 (3) Units
World Language 2 (3) Units
Visual or Performing Arts 1 Units
Additional Courses 1 additional unit

Students may be accepted at colleges and universities on "conditional" admission. A conditional admission
means the university might request the completion of a specific course prior to admission at the college or
university.
The courses listed above represent a recommended high school curriculum for most colleges and
universities. Some will accept fewer credits, and some will require more than what you see in the list
above. We stress, again, the need to review what you know about the admission requirements as soon as
possible, since there is considerable variation in college/university admission standards and requirements.
The appropriate college catalog or web page should be consulted for more information.

We stress, also, that college admission cannot be assured simply by the accumulation of the required high
school credits but is dependent to a great extent on one’s overall academic success. Often college
admission considers other factors such as ACT/SAT scores, participation in extra-curricular activities, the
quality of an admission essay, recommendations from the school and/or teachers, and enrollment in
advanced placement and honors courses.
ELIGIBILITY FOR PARTICIPATION IN HIGH SCHOOL ATHLETICS
If a student plans to participate in athletic activities, the student must be enrolled in and passing five credits
in each grading period (excluding PE classes, weightlifting, and math/science labs). In addition, each
student must earn a minimum GPA of 1.50 per quarter. If the GPA is not met, students will lose eligibility to
participate during the next grading period.
Summer school grades, exam grades, semester grades, credit flex courses, and final course grades do not
count toward eligibility. Grades earned in the previous quarter are used for determining eligibility purposes.
For example, eligibility for first quarter participation is determined by fourth quarter grades from the
previous school year.

OHSAA provides Guidelines for Student Athletic Eligibility, including how College Credit Plus impacts
eligibility.
NCAA ELIGIBILITY REQUIREMENTS FOR STUDENT ATHLETES
Students planning to compete in Division I or Division II athletics at the collegiate level are responsible for
ensuring their core courses meet NCAA eligibility standards. To verify course compliance and to learn
more about the academic requirements for student-athletes, visit the NCAA Eligibility Center.
Information concerning who needs to register with the Clearinghouse and what documents should be
submitted can be found in The Guide for College-Bound Student Athletes, located on the NCAA Eligibility
Website under the Student-Athletes tab. Athletes should be ready to report their SAT or ACT scores before
establishing eligibility. If there are any questions concerning this important part of becoming a student
athlete in college, please meet with your high school’s athletic director.
2025-26 OLENTANGY COURSE PLANNING GUIDE

COURSES WITH FEES
In some cases, select courses have additional supplies, exams (such as AP exams), print and digital
learning materials, and/or pay to participate fees associated with them. Course descriptions include
information about course fees. Contact your school’s Registrar for additional information and specific
questions about course fees and the amount of the course fees.
SCHEDULE CHANGE POLICY
The following regulations will be followed at all Olentangy high schools.
1. Due to commitments for staff employment/assignments and ordering of textbooks and other
supplies, no schedule changes can be made after the last school day except for the following
reasons:
a. Mechanical error changes
b. Changes necessitated by failures
c. Class balancing (guidance and administrative)
d. Subject-level changes (teacher recommendation)
e. Addition of a class in lieu of study hall during the same period
f. Administrative (teacher/guidance) recommendation
2. If a student wishes to appeal the schedule change policy, please follow the building guidelines.
3. Dropping classes – While we hope students have scheduled courses that make sense for
academic and personal growth goals, we recognize the factors outside of a student’s control in
completing the course may occur after the class begins; therefore, the drop policy outlined in the
items below will encourage students to talk to their teachers, reach out for help, if needed, and/or
consult their families and/or school counselors for a source of guidance, when considering a drop
of a class from their schedule.
a. DROP POLICY – FULL YEAR CLASSES- For classes scheduled for the full year, students
will be allowed to drop a class in the first quarter without any penalty; a drop of a class in
the second quarter would generate a grade on the transcript of Withdraw (W)*; and, during
the third or fourth quarters, a drop of a class would generate a grade on a transcript of
Withdraw (F) or (WF).
b. DROP POLICY – SEMESTER-LENGTH CLASSES – For classes scheduled in one semester,
a drop without penalty will be allowable through the first 25% of the course or the interim
period; a drop that takes place during the second 25% of the course would lead to a
Withdraw (W)* on the transcript, and a drop that takes place in the second half or second
50% of the semester would lead to a Withdraw F or (WF) on the transcript.
*NOTE: A mark of W on the transcript does not affect the overall GPA.
4. Adding classes – The need to add a class may arise when changes to a schedule are made or a
student decides about future goals that would require a schedule change (e.g., interested in
attending a culinary institute after a high school, so he/she/they change electives). The following
items outline the district ‘Add’ policy:
a. ADD POLICY – FULL YEAR CLASSES – Students may consult their counselors to add
class(es) up to 10 school days from the first day of the school year.
b. ADD POLICY – SEMESTER-LENGTH COURSES – Students may consult their counselors to
add classes up to 5 school days of the semester (includes both the fall and spring
semesters).

EDUCATIONAL OPTIONS
ADVANCED PLACEMENT (AP) PROGRAM
The Advanced Placement Program is an opportunity for students to pursue college-level studies while still
in secondary school. Through this program students might earn college credit, advanced placement credit,
or both. The expectations of all AP classes are at an advanced, or college level.

COLLEGE CREDIT PLUS
College Credit Plus (CCP) is an option for students to earn college credit while in middle or high school. To
enter CCP classes, you must complete the typical college admission process as guided by the
college/university. Once you complete the college admission process, you may take any course in their

COURSE AUDIT
To audit a course, a student must have received a "C-" or better in the original course. No credit will be
granted for audited courses. All course work is required, and grades will be assigned. The signature of the
classroom teacher is required.
COURSE RE-TAKE
A student may re-take a course if they received a "D+" or below in the original course or is recommended
to do so by the teacher. In order to be considered a re-take, it must be the exact same (identical) course.
The point value of the higher of the two grades (retake course grade or original grade) will be the only one
averaged into the student’s cumulative grade point average (GPA). However, the academic record of both
courses will be reflected in the student’s transcript. Credit for the course will not be duplicated. This retake
policy applies only to classes offered through the Olentangy Local School District. Students may not utilize
an Olentangy course offering as a retake option for an equivalent CCP course.

Students taking courses through College Credit Plus (CCP) must follow the college’s policy regarding
retaking a course. Students passing the course earning a grade of D- or above may choose to re-take a
course but must do so outside the CCP program at the expense of the family/student. The college course
grade is applied to the high school transcript. If the student receives a failing grade (E, F) for a CCP course,
the family/student will be responsible for reimbursing the district for the course's cost. The student may
retake the course in accordance with the college’s policies, and the new grade will be applied to the
student’s high school transcript.
CREDIT BELOW THE NINTH GRADE AND CREDIT FROM OTHER SCHOOLS
Olentangy Local Schools will award credit for "high school courses" taken prior to the ninth grade. In most
instances, a grade of "P" (passing) benefits a student's cumulative grade point average. Therefore, students
will receive a grade of "P" on their high school transcript for each high school course taken. If, before the
end of the first semester of the student’s senior year, the student and family wish to change the "P" grade
into an academic letter grade, they must complete the 8th-grade change request form. Upon written
request, the "P" grade will be replaced with the final grade issued on the student's middle school report
card. Students enrolled in high school courses that included a required end-of-course exam must take the
test to meet graduation requirements.

Students taking courses during summer school between their 8th- and 9th-grade year are considered 9th
graders and will be assigned a letter grade for course work.

Per Ohio law, students new to the district seeking credit must provide the following documentation on their
previous school's letterhead and/or an official transcript: 1) the course yielding credit is/was a high school
course; and 2) the course was taught by a teacher who held the appropriate secondary teaching
license/certificate for the course. Courses requested to be transferred but are not listed on the Olentangy
course selection guide, may or may not be accepted for transfer credit.

Students electing to re-take any course will not receive high school credit or a grade for the course below
the ninth grade.
CREDIT FLEXIBILITY OPTION
Olentangy recognizes that an effective educational program is one that supplies opportunities for all
students to customize aspects of their learning around needs and interests. The District Credit Flexibility
Plan offers options enabling students to earn high school credit by completing coursework or showing
proficiency of course content by completing activities and/or testing. Information detailing courses and
procedures for credit flexibility are available in student services or on the district’s website.
2025-26 OLENTANGY COURSE PLANNING GUIDE

COLLEGE CREDIT PLUS
Olentangy Local Schools participates in the College Credit Plus Program (CCP) where college-ready
students in grades 7-12 can earn high school and college credit at the same time. Detailed information is
available at https://www.ohiohighered.org/ccp. For detailed information about CCP at Olentangy Schools,
visit this link: https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/departments/curriculum-and-instruction/college-credit-plus
If you choose to pursue this opportunity, please complete your Intent to Participate Form and return it to
your counselor by May 1 each academic year. Counselors will assist students to determine if CCP is the
right choice for them. Approval of your Intent to Participate Form by your counselor allows students to start
the admissions process at the participating area college/university of your choice.

To apply: Students must follow the eligibility, admission, and registration process and meet eligibility
requirements (e.g., SAT/ACT) to be admitted to the selected college for CCP credit. Please notify your
counselor once you are admitted.

Admission for CCP does not guarantee availability of courses or seats. Students may not be able to enroll
in course for a variety of reasons including:
• A course may not be offered every semester, or it may not be offered during a semester that your
schedule allows;
• A course may not fit into a student's schedule;
• The class may be full, course enrolment will be limited by the number of seats available in the
course;
• The class may be restricted to students in a particular major, or to students who have completed
required;
• pre-requisite courses or achieved required placement test scores.

Advantages of College Credit Plus
2025-26 OLENTANGY COURSE PLANNING GUIDE
62
• Students successfully completing the college credit plus course earn college credit at no cost (up
to 30 credits/year)
• Students explore various kinds of classes not available at their high school.
• Students experience a college classroom environment, including the pace of learning, the kinds of
interactions in class, and the kinds of requirements.
What are the challenges that I should know about College Credit Plus, if any?
• College courses may be challenging and require additional time commitments. Once enrolled, ALL
correspondence about grades and course materials must be handled through the college /
university professor or advisor.
• All CCP courses will appear on the high school transcript and will be calculated into the student’s
overall GPA.
• Students may find that they have less time to be involved in extra-curricular activities and/or after
school jobs.
• It may have an impact on athletic eligibility, more information.
• Calendars will not match between high school and college/university, so you may have classes
during Olentangy school breaks.
• Students who enroll will be asked to repay the local school district for the cost of tuition and books
if they fail the course (earning a grade of E or F), or withdraw from a course after the "drop date"
unless the student is considered economically disadvantaged, or exceeds the 30 max credits
• Male students who are at least 18 years old and are Ohio residents must register with the Selective
Service System and provide their Selective Service number to their college within 30 days of their
18th birthday to participate in CCP. If a student does not register or provide their number, they will
not be considered a CCP participant for that term and will be responsible for all associated costs.
• Transportation is not provided.
• Federal financial aid may be impacted: federal guidelines limit the number of courses you may
attempt (even if they are taken while in high school) to 150% of the number of credits needed for a
degree.
Costs
Students are limited to the equivalent of 30 total credits per academic year paid by Olentangy. Students
wishing to earn more than 30 credits per academic year will be responsible for paying any course(s) that
exceed(s) the 30-credit limit. High school academic classes are equivalent to 3 college credits for
purposes of this calculation, so a student with an academic course in each of 8 high school class periods
already uses 24 credits (8 X 3 = 24). In this scenario, the student would be eligible for 6 CCP credits (30 -
24 = 6) at no cost to the student.

Frequently Asked Questions

Q: How do students sign up for CCP courses?
A: Please note each college/university has its own CCP registration requirements, deadlines for applying,
and processes. Please research the college/university process to be sure you have the accurate
information you need and meet the college/university deadlines and requirements. School counselors are
available to assist in the process, but they do not schedule or place students in CCP classes.

Q: How is the CCP course factored into the student’s high school GPA?
A: All College Credit Plus courses will be computed into the GPA using the same scale as Advanced
Placement and will be recorded on their high school transcripts. Since Olentangy Advanced Placement
courses are on a 5.0 scale, CCP courses are also on a 5.0 scale. In addition, the grade earned will also be
factored into the student’s GPA at the college.

2025-26 OLENTANGY COURSE PLANNING GUIDE
63
For students who do not pass a CCP course or withdraw from the course after the college’s required date),
the grade will appear on both the college and high school transcripts (i.e., F or W). The course grade of “F”
will be computed into the high school and college grade point average (GPA).
Q. How are college credits converted to high school credits?

Q: Is there a CCP probation or dismissal from the program?
A: Yes. If a student earns a lower than a 2.0 GPA in college or withdraws from two or more courses in the
same term, a student may either be put on probation or dismissed from the CCP program. Learn more
about the Underperforming Student Rule 3333-1-65.13.

Q: If I receive a D or above, can I retake the course to improve my grade?
A: If the college allows you to retake a course, you must do so outside the college credit program and at
your own expense.

Q: If I fail the course (E or F) can I retake the class?
A: It depends on the college policies. If they allow you to retake the course, then the new college grade
may be applied to the high school transcript. The course retake is at the expense of the student/family.
Q: What courses can I take?
A: Students may take a variety of courses as long as they qualify as a CCP course. Course offerings vary
from school to school. Please check the college or university website.
Q: Will colleges give credit for classes?
A: Any Ohio public college or university will give credit for courses that are part of the Transfer Assurance
Guide (TAG).
Q: How is a CCP course different from an Advanced Placement (AP) course?
A: The primary difference is that college credit is attained by successfully completing the requirements of
the course, rather than earning a necessary score on an exam, as is the case with an AP course. Three
CCP credit hours equals 1 HS Credit. Students should speak with their counselors for help deciding what
options are best for them.
Q: Why might students and parents opt for CCP classes when AP classes courses are widely
recognized by universities across the country?
A: Even with all the AP classes available at Olentangy high schools, CCP classes allow for exploration of
the professional studies disciplines, such as Education, Business, and Athletic Training. AP testing is also
different than CCP end of semester tests.
How many colleges and universities in Ohio will recognize CCP credit?
A: All Ohio public colleges and universities accept TAG courses in the same way they do AP courses.
Students who intend to attend private or out-of-state college/universities may find AP to be a better option
for them to ensure the transfer of credit.

Q: What if the Olentangy calendar and my college calendar do not align? Which calendar do I follow?
A: Students who are enrolled in CCP courses will follow the college academic calendar.
Q: How do families and students learn more information about the CCP?
A: Information about CCP will be presented to students during their scheduling meetings. The District has
archived videos on the district webpage about CCP. CCP information is also posted on the high school
websites. For more information, see the district website:
https://www.olentangy.k12.oh.us/departments/curriculum-and-instruction/college-credit-plus
Q: How many students will be enrolled in CCP courses?
A: CCP class size will be consistent with the college/university class sizes.
Q: Will transportation be provided to colleges by the school district?
A: No. Students will need to provide their own transportation and pay for a parking pass, if required.
OLENTANGY & COLUMBUS STATE COMMUNITY CCP PARTNERSHIP
College Credit Plus is an option for students to earn college credit while in high school. Olentangy Local
Schools and Columbus State Community College have formed a strong partnership and some courses are
offered during the first three periods of the high school day at the Columbus State Delaware Campus.

Below are the steps to gain admission to Columbus State Community College:
I. Follow the student eligibility process and demonstrate college eligibility on assessments
II. Complete the free CSCC application online

Please contact CSCC if you have additional questions.
Columbus State Community College Building Blocks: Which block is right for me?

The College Building Blocks are a series of suggested courses based on popular bachelor degree
programs. Students can use the blocks as a guide as they begin exploring their College Credit Plus
options. The College Building Blocks give students the flexibility to choose courses that best fit their needs
and create individualized 15 - 30-hour college pathways. Each block was designed to ensure students
were taking appropriate courses for their desired 4-year degree program. If students have questions about
transfer options, a CSCC advisor is happy to help students connect with our university partners.
TAG AND OTM: Pathway to college credit. To ensure the transferability of courses, students can refer to
the Transfer Assurance Guides (TAG) and the Ohio Transfer Module (OTM). TAG and OTM courses are
approved by the Ohio Legislature to transfer to any in-state, public institution. Courses typically do transfer
out of state and to private schools but are not guaranteed by the state of Ohio. Students may earn a
certificate by completing the minimum requirements of the OTM.

Columbus State also offers many lucrative career and technical degree opportunities for students. Students
are able to take courses in many of the career and technical programs while participating in the College
Credit Plus program. Some career and technical programs have age restrictions that exclude students in
CCP from taking courses in those areas. Students should meet with a CSCC advisor prior to choosing
career and technical courses to ensure their eligibility as well as match their educational and career goals.

Below are several popular degree “blocks” and their suggested courses. These interest areas do not
encompass all potential degrees or career interests. Some of the courses listed are not TAG or OTM
2025-26 OLENTANGY COURSE PLANNING GUIDE
65
approved, however all typically transfer to most 4-year institutions. If students do not see their anticipated
degree area, a CSCC advisor can help determine which path may best suit their goals.

Students must meet course prerequisites for all courses listed in the College Building Blocks. Students can
discover course prerequisites, course descriptions, and current semester schedules at the below web link:
http://www.cscc.edu/academics/courses.

Disclaimer: Courses are subject to change as deemed appropriate by Columbus State Community College.
Course availability varies by semester and is determined by each academic department. Courses may not
always be available in the desired format or at the campus location a student wishes to attend. Students
should always check the current semester schedule of courses prior to selecting courses for the semester
they wish to enroll to ensure courses fit their high school academic plan.
CSCC Advising Contacts:
Columbus Campus Location: ccpadvising@cscc.edu
Delaware Campus Location: Student can meet with any advisor at the Delaware Campus by contacting
their appointment line: 740-203-8345

CSCC CCP Course Eligibility:
The first fifteen (15) hours of a student’s participation must be transferable, part of a technical certificate
program or pathway, a study skills or academic success course, or in the areas of computer science.
Information technology, anatomy, physiology, foreign language, or American Sign Language. These are

School and are available to high school students of the Olentangy, Delaware, Buckeye Valley, and Big
Walnut districts. Chartered by Congress in 1966, this program is charged with integrating programs of
aerospace education, citizenship, leadership, team-building skills, and voluntary community service with
the curricula of their host high schools. and carries no obligation to enter military service. In addition,
AFJROTC makes available extensive voluntary extracurricular activities such as field trips, interscholastic
drill team, rocket club, raider (Fitness Team), and community service projects. The program is not an
extension of the recruiting services of any branch of armed service and there is no military obligation
associated with this course. Transportation is not provided by OLSD. For more information, visit this fact
sheet:
https://resources.finalsite.net/images/v1610386833/olentangyk12ohus/bpp9cgasveuctp6zdfva/AFJROTCFa
ctSheet.pdf
Aerospace Science: This portion of the AFJROTC curriculum acquaints students with the elements of
aerospace and the aerospace environment. It introduces them to the principles of aircraft flight and
navigation, the history of aviation, the development of air power, contemporary aviation, human
requirements of flight, cultural and global awareness, geography, the space environment, space programs,
space technology, rocketry, propulsion, the aerospace industry, and survival.

ensure only those cadets holding corps management/leadership positions are enrolled in the course. This
hands-on experience affords cadets the opportunity to put theories of previous leadership courses into
practice. Planning, organizing, coordinating, directing, controlling, and decision-making will be done by
cadets. They will put into practice their communication, decision-making, personal interaction, managerial,
and organizational skills. Instructors should keep in mind that since there is no textbook for this course, the
course syllabus will be structured so that cadets achieve course objectives by completing corps
management activities.
